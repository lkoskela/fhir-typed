# Generated type definitions for FHIR resources

This directory contains the generated type definitions for FHIR resources.

The types are generated using the `fhir-codegen` tool, which is a tool that generates TypeScript types from the FHIR definitions.

Re-generate types with:
```
npm run codegen:update
```

In order to also update the `fhir-codegen` tool itself, use:
```
npm run codegen:update-all
```
